# Simple ToDo List App

This is a basic ToDo list app created as a project to improve my skills in Next.js, TypeScript, and Prisma, and now, NextAuth for GitHub authentication.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- List tasks with a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Authenticate with GitHub to personalize your ToDo list.

## Technologies Used

I chose these technologies for specific reasons:

- **Next.js**: It's a great framework that helps with server-side rendering and makes routing a breeze. This choice made sense as I was building a web app and wanted a solid foundation.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript adds a layer of safety to the project. It catches errors early, making the codebase more robust and understandable.

- **Prisma**: For managing the database, I went with Prisma. It simplifies working with the database and provides strong type safety, aligning well with the TypeScript codebase.

- **NextAuth**: To enhance the app's functionality, I've integrated NextAuth for GitHub authentication. This allows users to log in with their GitHub accounts, providing a personalized experience.
